# Obesity_Classification_DeepLearning_Project
The Obesity Classification project uses deep learning to identify obesity levels based on input features such as BMI, age, and lifestyle habits. By leveraging neural networks, the model predicts obesity categories and provides personalized healthy tips like balanced diet, regular exercise, and portion control to reduce obesity.
